# NeuroFlow-SQL-Query
For each month since launch, what percentage of the patients added in said month did an activity in that month

Notes:
- I had no example data to run this off

Assumptions:
- Because of the varying length of months, the query only counts events that are in the same month as the sign up. This may unfairly disqualify patients who, for example, joined on July 25th but still did an activity on August 1st.
